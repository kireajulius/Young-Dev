INTRODUCTION
What is Life? 
Life is- Things organized to use energy and raw materials from their environment, maintain their integrity and reproduce.
What is Physiology? 
-Derived from two Greek words;-Physis meaning Nature and Logy meaning study of
Physiology therefore is the branch of Biology dealing with the study of nature.
In physiology, scientific methods are applied to determine how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that they have in a living system. Physiology is a large field of study and is  divided into, among others: human physiology, animal physiology, plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology bacterial physiology and viral physiology
Why study Animal Physiology?
▸Curiosity -I just want to know.
▸Applications -I want to profit from what I know.
▸Insights -Now what do I do with what I know?

Animals are an import tool in the study of physiology.
August Krogh principle:
*For a large number of physiological problems, there will be some animal on which it can be most conveniently studied*.

In using animals physiologists must accept to take certain moral responsibilities-:
Animals are used only for worthwhile experiments
All necessary steps are taken to minimize pain and distress
All possible alternatives to the use of animals are considered

Levels of Organization
To understand how the body functions and coordinates its activities, it is important to understand its components and how they are organized at various levels.</p>
